# makeup_expires2

Makeup Expires! is an app to help users keep track of their makeup products and what is about to expire.

## Getting Started
Users can add products they've opened writing the product type and description, edit products they've created, and delete products they threw out. The products are color coded by when they will expire and change color as they get closer to the expiry date.
Red  products are very close to expiry, orange and yellow are in the middle, and green is far from expiry.
